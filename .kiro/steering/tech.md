# Technology Stack

## Architecture

This is a server-rendered React application built with Next.js, leveraging the App Router for modern development practices.

## Core Technologies

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.x
- **Runtime**: Node.js (implied by Next.js)

## Key Libraries

- **React**: 18.x
- **Mermaid**: For diagram rendering.
- **react-markdown**: For parsing and rendering Markdown.
- **remark-gfm**: GitHub Flavored Markdown plugin.

## Development Standards

### Type Safety
Strict TypeScript mode is enforced to ensure type safety across the codebase.

### Code Quality
ESLint is used for maintaining code quality and adherence to defined standards, integrated via `next lint`.

### Testing
(Placeholder: Testing framework and conventions to be defined, e.g., Jest, React Testing Library)

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn (for package management)

### Common Commands
